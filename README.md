# The Splaynck
My first foray into the world of mechanical keyboards.
![the finished keyboard](/images/done.jpg)
# What is it?
![banana for scale](/images/for_scale2.jpg)
- A compact, ergonomic keyboard for a lowish price. (~$50. including components in bulk, about $73 excluding filament.)
- inspired by the Katana60 and the SICK-68.
# When is it?
- Now.
  - *Starting now. Total time is ~25 hours: ~16h printing, ~8 soldering (at least for me).
- Not now.
  - compatability with Boardsource's Peg
# Why is it?
- A ortholinear/grid layout is the most efficient in terms of space, but forces the wrists to bend outwards (uncomfortable).
- Splaying the rows outwards encourages neutral/reduced wrist angle which is more comfortable.
# How?
- The case is 3d printed and electronics are handwired/soldered.
- Everything else can be from Amazon.
- The parts I used/were bought (prices at time of purchase): 
  - [Akko ocean blue switches](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XX7TTZB/) - $14
    - 45x of any Cherry MX compatable switch will work.
  - [1N4148 diodes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XB1R2NK) - $5
  - [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TVF499B/) - $8
  - [28 AWG wire](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F8PO7UK/) - $6
  - [M3 threaded inserts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MCW7ZN5/) - $8
  - [M3x8 FHCS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D4VHJJ6/) - $7.58
  - [YMDK DSA blanks](https://amazon.com/dp/B08YR6KNX9/) - $23
    - exact keycap sizes used:
      | size | Quantity |
      | ------------- | ------------- |
      | 1u    | 41 |
      | 1.25u | 2  |
      | 1.5u  | 2  |
    - It is possible to use all 1u keycaps. Just print the top pieces with "ortho" in the file names.
