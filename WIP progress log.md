# CAD/Build log (this itself is not finished.)
## V0.0 - Minimum Viable-45
![V0.0](/images/plate_v0.0_final_state.PNG)
- 45 keys
- Designed around normal keycap sizes
- Thicc plate - 10mm
- Progressed only to first extrusion/switch cutouts
## V0.1 - the Splaynck (splay+planck)
![V0.1 top](/images/plate_v0.1_top.PNG)
![V0.1 bottom](/images/plate_v0.1_bottom.PNG)
- 45 keys (spacebar will be 2x1u)
- Designed around planck/ortho sets
### Notes
- Adopted for smaller overall size - 266mm wide. It can theoretically be printed in one piece.
- No stabilizers, no stabilizer problems
### Log
#### 05/29/2022 
- Plate mostly done - switch cutouts and relief cuts.
- I would like to have parts in hand to test the following
    - switch fit
    - Threaded insert holes
    - Controller mount
- To do 
- Holes for threaded inserts
- Pi Pico mount
- Bottom plate - should be the simplest part
## V0.2 - It’s time to stop ok? no more
### Notes
- SICK-68 style construction
- I should probably just finish one to test layout/preliminary feel before changing more things.
    - As of 06.20.22, I deny the existence of the me who typed the above.
- Addition of pseudo HHKB variant
- Designed for blank uniform profile sets
- Microcontroller sled/cartridge
    - Interference fit
    - Compatible with 
        - Pi pico
        - Pro micro (scrapped)
- Dimensions
    - Sub 16mm height from tabletop to top of plate
    - 10x8mm bezel
    - 2mm clearance between keycap and bezel
    - 5x20mm dowel pins with squared bottom
